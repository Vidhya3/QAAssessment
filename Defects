1. "/stats end point should accept no data " as in POST method should not be allowed for /stats endpoint.

Test result : FAIL

2. When no data is entered in the json and POST call is made to the /hash endpoint, 200 OK status comes up and a job identifier also comes up as a response.
  When there is no data entered while making a POST call,204 No Content status code can be displayed instead of 200 OK.
  Also No job identifier should be displayed as a response
  
Test result: FAIL

3. When we pass an empty string for password and send a POST call to /hash endpoint, 200 OK response code comes up which is incorrect. Generally, when a property is mandatory, ie. required, 
it can never be null.
